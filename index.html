<h1>Creating your first webpage using GitHub - How To:</h1><h1></h1>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, you’ll need to sign up for your free GitHub account. Choose a username and password that will be easy for you to remember. Remember, the more memorable your username is, the more likely it’ll be easier for others to remember as well.</li>
<li>Once you’ve created your account, you’ll need to select “Create new repository” to create a space to store your projects. Name it “yourusername.github.io”.</li>
<li>Then choose "uploading an existing file" from the quick set up page.</li>
<li>Using VSCode (or your editor of choice), open a folder and create a file in it. Name it “index.html”.</li>
<li>Next, choose a photo - “something.jpeg”. Be sure the photo is in the same folder.</li>
<li>Now that you have all that you need, let’s focus on what changes to make to that index.html file in your editor. Line 1) will define what language is being used – in this case, HTML. On line 2) type the heading tag (&lth1&gt), your heading, and then the closing tag (&lt/h1&gt). Together, it will look like this: &lth1&gtYour Heading&lt/h1&gt</li>
<li>Next, you’ll need to include an image tag using the file name of the photo you chose in the earlier step. It will look like this: &ltimg src=”something.jpeg”/&gt</li>
<li>Finally, you’ll include the HTML closing tag &lt/html&gt</li>
<li>The last step is to drag both your image file and your index.html file into your repository. After that, select "commit changes".</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ve now created your very first webpage using GitHub. In your browser, go to "yourusername.github.io" to see your creation. This is a <em>very</em> basic explanation and there is much more you can do with this later on, but for now… <strong>Celebrate yourself! You did it!</strong></p>
